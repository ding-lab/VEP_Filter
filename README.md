# VEP_Filter

Series of TinDaisy modules for filtering VCF files based on attributes from VEP annotation.

Filtering based on pyVCF filters as described [here](https://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FILTERS.html#adding-a-filter)

3 filters implemented:

* AF (allele frequency) filter
* Consequence filter
* dbSnP filter with cosmic and clinvar rescue

All 3 filters rely on VCF annotation provided by VEP annotation
