Several levels of calls available for testing

- direct\_call: Calling directly from within container
- docker\_call: Instantiate docker container and call scripts within it
- cwl\_call: Run rabix or Cromwell workflow manager to call CWL workflow

At this time, we are not distributing sample germline calls.  It would be helpful
to call germline variants with publicly accessible data
